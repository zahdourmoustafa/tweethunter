# The Art of Crafting Viral Whispers: Backend Saga for AI Tweet Editor

Imagine, if you will, a digital atelier where raw viral tweets are sculpted into personalized masterpieces. As the master storyteller behind TweetHunter's backend, I'm about to weave a tale of code and creativity that brings our AI Tweet Editor to life. This isn't just implementation—it's alchemy, transforming OpenAI's raw power through Vercel AI SDK into tools that feel like extensions of a copywriter's intuition. We'll craft a system so seamless, users will swear it's magic, not machinery.

Our hero's journey begins in the shadows of the server, where TRPC endpoints await their calling. We'll harness Vercel AI SDK's streaming capabilities to deliver responses that unfold like a gripping novel, word by word, keeping users on the edge of their seats. Each of our 12 AI tools? Not mere functions, but characters with distinct voices and purposes, drawn from their names like actors embodying roles on a grand stage.

## Chapter 1: The Foundation - Architecture Blueprint

Picture the backend as a grand library, with TRPC as the wise librarian organizing our AI tomes. We'll create a dedicated TRPC router for the editor, nestled in `src/server/api/routers/aiEditor.ts`. This router will house procedures for generation, each attuned to a specific tool's essence.

Key pillars:
- **Streaming First**: Using Vercel AI SDK's `streamText`, we'll deliver responses in real-time, mimicking the flow of human thought.
- **Prompt Mastery**: Custom system prompts for each tool, infused with the original tweet's spirit—metrics, tone, and viral DNA preserved.
- **Format Fidelity**: Every generation honors the source tweet's structure—be it single quip or threaded narrative—ensuring outputs feel like natural evolutions, not reinventions.
- **Undetectable Humanity**: Prompts engineered to evade AI detectors, channeling the nuance of seasoned storytellers.

We'll integrate with our Drizzle ORM for logging generations, saving gems to the database without a hitch.

## Chapter 2: The Ensemble - AI Tools and Their Roles

Each tool is a specialist, their name dictating their dramatic role in our play. We'll define an enum of tool types in `src/lib/types/aiTools.ts`, mapping names to prompt templates. Here's how they come alive:

1. **🚀 Copywriting Tips** - The Sage Advisor: Analyzes structure, suggests hooks and CTAs like a veteran editor whispering improvements.
   
2. **✍️ Keep Writing** - The Muse Extender: Continues the narrative thread, building on ideas with seamless flow, as if the original author never stopped typing.

3. **😊 Add Emojis** - The Expressive Painter: Strategically places emojis to amplify emotion, like a artist adding color without overwhelming the canvas.

4. **✂️ Make Shorter** - The Precise Editor: Trims excess while sharpening impact, distilling essence like a poet counting syllables.

5. **🔄 Expand Tweet** - The Thread Weaver: Transforms singles into engaging threads, linking ideas like chapters in a novella.

6. **▶️ Create Hook** - The Attention Magnet: Crafts opening lines that grab like a storyteller's "Once upon a time," pulling readers in.

7. **📢 Create CTA** - The Rally Crier: Adds compelling calls-to-action, urging engagement like a charismatic leader.

8. **⚡ Improve Tweet** - The Polish Master: General enhancements for clarity and punch, refining rough diamonds.

9. **💪 More Assertive** - The Bold Orator: Infuses confidence, strengthening voice like a debate champion.

10. **😎 More Casual** - The Friendly Conversationalist: Relaxes tone to chatty vibes, like bantering with old friends.

11. **👔 More Formal** - The Professional Diplomat: Elevates language to polished prose, suitable for boardrooms.

12. **🔧 Fix Grammar** - The Meticulous Proofreader: Corrects without altering soul, ensuring flawless delivery.

13. **💡 Tweet Ideas** - The Idea Generator: Sparks related concepts, brainstorming like a creative brainstorming session.

For each, the prompt will echo the original tweet's format—length, style, hashtags if present—ensuring the output blends invisibly.

## Chapter 3: The Ritual - Implementation Steps

Let's roll up our sleeves and script this epic.

1. **Setup Vercel AI SDK**: In `package.json`, ensure `@ai-sdk/openai` is installed. Configure in `src/lib/ai/config.ts` with `createOpenAI` using `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`.

2. **TRPC Router Creation**: In `src/server/api/routers/aiEditor.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import { createTRPCRouter, protectedProcedure } from '~/server/api/trpc';
   import { z } from 'zod';
   import { streamText } from 'ai';
   import { openai } from '~/lib/ai/config'; // Our OpenAI instance

   export const aiEditorRouter = createTRPCRouter({
     generate: protectedProcedure
       .input(z.object({
         tool: z.enum([...toolEnum]), // From types
         originalTweet: z.string(),
         customPrompt: z.string().optional(),
         // Other options like tone, length
       }))
       .query(async ({ input }) => { // Use mutation if stateful
         const systemPrompt = getToolPrompt(input.tool, input.originalTweet);
         const result = await streamText({
           model: openai('gpt-4o'),
           system: systemPrompt,
           prompt: input.customPrompt || input.originalTweet,
         });
         return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse(); // Stream back
       }),
   });
   ```

3. **Prompt Factory**: In `src/lib/ai/prompts.ts`, a function `getToolPrompt(tool, original)` that crafts bespoke system prompts, e.g.:
   - Inject original metrics: "Original had {likes} likes—aim to match that energy."
   - Mandate format mimicry: "Output in the same structure as the input tweet."

4. **Database Dance**: Use Drizzle to log generations in `ai_generations` table, capturing input/output for analytics and improvements.

5. **Error Grace**: Wrap in try-catch, fallback to polite messages if API hiccups.

6. **Testing Tales**: Script unit tests for each tool, verifying output mimics input format and embodies the role.

## Chapter 4: The Climax - Integration and Polish

Hook into the frontend's `ai-tool-modal.tsx` via TRPC client, streaming responses to update the output area live. For threads, handle multi-part generations.

Monitor costs with OpenAI's usage tracking, optimize prompts for efficiency.

In this backend odyssey, we've not just coded—we've conjured a system where AI whispers secrets of virality, undetectable, impressive, and utterly human.
