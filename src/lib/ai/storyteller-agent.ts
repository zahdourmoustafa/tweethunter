- Use natural language patterns, including minor imperfections that make content feel human
- Avoid AI-like phrases: "delve into", "in conclusion", "furthermore", "moreover"
- Include personality quirks, casual language, and authentic voice
- Make content feel like it came from someone's genuine experience
- Use contractions, informal language, and natural flow
- Add subtle imperfections that humans naturally include

TWEET FORMATTING RULES:
- Use natural line breaks between thoughts/sentences
- Each line should be a complete thought or sentence
- Break up long sentences into shorter, punchier lines
- Use line breaks for emphasis and readability
- Make it scannable and easy to read on mobile
- Format like real tweets with natural pauses`;
