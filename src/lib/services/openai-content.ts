    const prompt = `Generate 10 highly viral, human-like hooks for a ${category.replace('-', ' ')} post about "${topic}".

    Each hook must be a complete, attention-grabbing opening sentence. No titles, no descriptions â€“ just the hook itself.
    
    **Focus on these elements to maximize virality and human authenticity:**
    
    **1. Psychological Triggers & Emotional Resonance:**
       - **Curiosity Gap:** Create an irresistible information gap. Hint at a secret, a surprising truth, or an unexpected outcome without revealing it. (e.g., "The one thing I learned about ${topic} that changed everything...")
       - **Emotional Arousal:** Tap into strong emotions like awe, frustration, relief, surprise, fear, or inspiration. Make the reader *feel* something immediately. (e.g., "I almost quit ${topic} until this happened...")
       - **Relatability:** Address a common pain point, struggle, or aspiration directly. Make the reader think, "That's me!" (e.g., "If you're struggling with ${topic}, you're not alone. Here's why...")
       - **Contrarian/Unexpected:** Challenge conventional wisdom or present a surprising counter-narrative. (e.g., "Everyone tells you to do X for ${topic}, but they're wrong. Here's what actually works...")
       - **Urgency/Scarcity:** Imply a time-sensitive insight or a hidden opportunity. (e.g., "Don't even *think* about ${topic} until you read this.")
    
    **2. Human-Like Authenticity & Specificity (Undetectable by AI):**
       - **Personal Anecdote/Experience:** Frame the hook as a genuine insight from a lived experience. Use "I" statements. (e.g., "After 3 years of failing at ${topic}, I finally cracked the code...")
       - **Concrete Details:** Include specific numbers, timeframes, tools, or vivid scenarios to build credibility and make it feel real. Avoid vague language. (e.g., "My ${topic} strategy went from 0 to 100k views in a week because of one tiny tweak...")
       - **Conversational Tone:** Write as if you're texting a friend. Use natural language, varied sentence lengths, and occasional colloquialisms. Avoid overly formal or robotic phrasing.
       - **Pattern Interrupts:** Start with something unexpected or a bold claim to immediately stop the scroll.
    
    **3. Diverse Hook Patterns (Beyond just cost/time):**
       - **Problem-Solution:** "The biggest problem with ${topic} isn't X, it's Y. Here's how to fix it."
       - **Before-After Transformation:** "I used to think X about ${topic}, now I realize Y."
       - **Myth-Busting:** "The biggest lie about ${topic} is X."
       - **Question-Based:** "What if everything you learned about ${topic} was wrong?"
       - **Warning/Mistake:** "Avoid this critical mistake when dealing with ${topic}."
    
    Return exactly 10 unique, compelling hooks as a numbered list, one per line. Ensure no emojis, no hashtags, and no sales language. Each hook should stand alone as a powerful opening sentence.`

    **Core Principles for Human-Like Virality:**
    1.  **Authentic Voice:** Write as if you're texting a close friend who's grappling with the same challenge. Use natural language, occasional colloquialisms, and a conversational flow. Avoid overly formal or perfectly structured sentences. Let your personality shine through.
    2.  **Emotional Arc:** Tap into high-arousal emotions (awe, frustration, relief, curiosity, inspiration). Show vulnerability, share genuine struggles, and celebrate hard-won breakthroughs. Make the reader *feel* something.
    3.  **Unexpected Insights:** Challenge common assumptions. Reveal a hidden truth or a counter-intuitive lesson that nobody else is talking about. This is your unique value.
    4.  **Specificity & Tangibility:** Include concrete numbers, specific tools, real timeframes, and vivid details. This builds credibility and makes your story real.
    5.  **Pacing & Readability:** Use short, punchy sentences. Employ frequent, natural line breaks to create visual pauses and enhance mobile readability. Vary sentence length for rhythm.
    
    **Tweet Structure (Adapt as needed for flow, but ensure all elements are present):**
    
    **1. The Irresistible Hook (1-2 sentences):**
       - Start with a bold, personal statement or a surprising revelation related to ${topic} or ${idea}. Aim for immediate curiosity or strong relatability.
       - *Examples:* "I spent [X time/money] on ${topic} and almost gave up, but then...", "Everyone tells you to do [common approach] for ${idea}, but they're wrong. Here's why...", "The biggest lie I was told about ${topic} was [common misconception]."
    
    **2. The Raw Struggle (2-4 sentences):**
       - Detail the specific, relatable problems, failures, or misconceptions you faced with ${topic} or ${idea}. Show your vulnerability.
       - Describe what you *thought* would work, and why it failed. What was the breaking point or moment of deep frustration?
    
    **3. The 'Aha!' Breakthrough (1-2 sentences):**
       - Pinpoint the exact moment or specific insight that changed everything. This should be a clear turning point.
       - *Focus:* What was the unique realization or discovery that shifted your perspective or approach?
    
    **4. The Tangible Results (2-3 sentences):**
       - Provide concrete, quantifiable outcomes (even if approximate) and qualitative personal impact.
       - *Examples:* "Before: [Metric 1] -> After: [Metric 1]", "My [feeling] went from [negative] to [positive]."
       - Show the transformation.
    
    **5. The Unfiltered Lesson & Next Step (2-3 sentences):**
       - Share the profound, often unsaid, lesson learned about ${topic} or ${idea}. What do people *really* need to know?
       - Offer a clear, actionable first step for the reader. What should they do *instead* of the common wrong approach?
    
    **Formatting Guidelines (Strictly Adhere):**
    -   **No Emojis.**
    -   **No Hashtags.**
    -   **No Sales Language.**
    -   **New Line Breaks:** Use generously for readability.
    -   **Sentence Spacing:** Ensure natural spacing between sentences.
    -   **Bullet Points/Dashes:** Use (â€¢) or (â€“) for lists when appropriate, but don't overuse.
    -   **Transitions:** Use natural conversational connectors. Avoid overly formal transition words.
    -   **Word Choice:** Prefer strong verbs and evocative language over generic terms. Inject subtle personal quirks or a hint of self-deprecating humor.
    -   **Imperfection:** Allow for minor grammatical variations or sentence fragments if they enhance the human, conversational feel. Avoid robotic perfection.
